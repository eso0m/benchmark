# benchmark
Repository for anharmonic frequency benchmark project from Y4 of my MChem.

The aim of the project was to analyse anharmonic vibrational frequency data calculated using approximate computational models and compare it to its harmonic counterparts. The analysis was focused on 3 main aspects: accuracy of the obtained data compared to the experiemtnal results, time required to compute the data and reliability of the used models.
